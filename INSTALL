0. the smapi "stable" package is required for the fidoconfig packages

1. Put the fidoconfig package in the directory where the other packages of fido
   linux reside:

   /usr/src/packages/        -> smapi/
                             -> hpt/
                             -> fidoconfig/

2a. Determine which makefile you need to use and copy it to "makefile".

2b. compile and install fidoconfig:
	$ make
	$ make install

3. Ensure /usr/local/lib/ is in /etc/ld.so.conf

4. execute ldconfig as root

5. write a fido config according to the proposal which is also in this package.
   If your are just some normal point, give the shell script fidoInst a
   chance. Always test the config with the tparser tool, which you can place
   in a directory like /usr/local/bin.

You're ready. Now you can install hpt, and other software which uses fidoconfig.
