Description: Library to access the fidoconfig
 The design goal of fidoconfig was to provide one config-file for several
 different fido software packages like editor, tosser etc.
 An additional aim was to have one library (fidoconfig) which can be used by
 all programs.
 The advantage is you only have to edit one config-file, so changing your
 system is much easier than with common software packages. Also bugs can only
 creep in one library and not in thousands over thousands libraries.
