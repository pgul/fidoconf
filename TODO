- if (( a && b ) || c) by Pavel Golchouk
- getArea(TP_LOCAL|TP_ECHO|TP_BAD|TP_DUPE|TP_FILE)
- fix "-manual" vs. "-mandatory": 
  manual means: subscription/unsubscription not allowed
  mandatory means: subscription allowed, unsubscription not allowed
- create section for HTick in proposal.texi since some keywords (i. e. autofilecreate) aren't properly documented
- add keyword (definable for each link) "FileFixFSC87Subset" (when on (default!) HTick will behave as if only a subset of FSC87 commands were implemented (useful for FileScan links) and *ignore* unknown TIC entries instead of stopping processing)) to the above HTick section
