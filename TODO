- if (( a && b ) || c) by Pavel Gulchouk
- getArea(TP_LOCAL|TP_ECHO|TP_BAD|TP_DUPE|TP_FILE)
- create section for HTick in proposal.texi since some keywords (i. e.
  autofilecreate) aren't properly documented
- add keyword (definable for each link) "FileFixFSC87Subset" (when on
  (default!) HTick will behave as if only a subset of FSC87 commands were
  implemented (useful for FileScan links) and *ignore* unknown TIC entries
  instead of stopping processing)) to the above HTick section
