- route statements which are defined in the middle of several link statements
  are broken, because there is a realloc of config->links! Maybe there are
  more bugs like this in the current sources
- unify routes (make route, routeMail & routeFile "the same", so that routing
  depends on their order in the config), add NoPack (ignore mails to this
  address, leave them in the netmail area)
- getArea(TP_LOCAL|TP_ECHO|TP_BAD|TP_DUPE|TP_FILE)
- fix "0" groups (to NULL)
- fix dumping of
  - Unpack
  - fReqFromUplink
  - netMailArea
  - dupeArea
  - badArea
  - echoArea

- dump remaps, bbsareas and fileareas
- for htick developers (add to doc & tparser):
    filefixkillreports
    filefixkillrequests
    semadir
    badfilesdir
    bbsarea
    autofilecreate
    autofilecreatedefaults
    savetick
    execonfile
    origininannounce
