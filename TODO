- getArea(TP_LOCAL|TP_ECHO|TP_BAD|TP_DUPE|TP_FILE)
- route statements which are defined in the middle of several link statements
  are broken, because there is a realloc of config->links! Maybe there are
  more bugs like this in the current sources
- dump remaps, bbsareas and fileareas
- unify routes (make route, routeMail & routeFile "the same", so that routing
  depends on their order in the config), add NoPack (ignore mails to this
  address, leave them in the netmail area)
- document ExecOnFile, filefixkillreports [ to Georgy :-> ]
- fix "0" groups (to NULL)
- ArcMailAddr (address PKT etc. to <Addr>, but send it to <ArcMailAddr>)
- add savetic, origininannounce to tparser & doc

  There're a lot of undocumented tokens and maybe area options in
  fidoconfig. As i quickly could find:

  filefixkillreports
  filefixkillrequests
  semadir
  badfilesdir
  bbsarea
  autofilecreate
  autofilecreatedefaults
  ...

  Some descriptions are present in htick/FidoConfigKeywords, but no
  corresponding items were found in fidoconfig/proposal.texi. Maybe
  some of tokens must be removed from fidoconfig/line.c...
