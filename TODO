- route statements which are defined in the middle of several link statements
  are broken, because there is a realloc of config->links! Maybe there are
  more bugs like this in the current sources
- dump remaps, bbsareas and fileareas
- unify routes (make route, routeMail & routeFile "the same", so that routing
  depends on their order in the config)
- document linkGrp
- document ExecOnFile, filefixkillreports [ to Georgy :-> ]
- fix "0" groups (to NULL)
- ArcMailAddr (address PKT etc. to <Addr>, but send it to <ArcMailAddr>)
- add savetic, origininannounce to tparser & doc
